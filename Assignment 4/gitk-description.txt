In the X11 window, I see a couple of panes.
In one of the top left windows, theres a GUI describing the commits 
and branches and merges of the previous history. 
The top middle window displays a list of names and emails associated
with the actions that they did(commit, merge, etc) on the top left
window. On the top right window, there is a log of the time at which
the action was performed by the person. The overall top tab of the
GUI shows the git log in an intuitive and sorted fashion. Below them,
there is information of the SHA1 hash for the given commit.

On the bottom, there is a window displaying the change log of each
commit. Displaying individual logs on the left, and showing the
file structure on the right side(if pressed Tree). The file structure
is the current structure of the tree given that time frame of commit.

There are various searching functions like the SHA1 hash, the name of
commit and specific information of the git tags.
