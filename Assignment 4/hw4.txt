#1.
$ touch hw4.txt
$ vim h4.txt
enter this file

#2.
$ git checkout v3.0 
$ git branch quote

The first command allowed me to checkout v3.0, specified in the
instructions.

The second command allowed me to create a branch called quote @ v3.0

#3.
I took the quote-3.0-patch.txt, and patched the diffutils folder
by using the following:

$ patch -p1 < quote-3.0-patch.txt
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

#4 & 5.
To use the add-change-log-entry-other-window function, I used
$ emacs
C-x 4 a

I wrote in this for my ChangeLog:
        * src/cmp.c: Changed the quotation marks to standard.
        * src/diff.c: Changed the quotation marks to standard
                        (also in string literal).
        * src/diff3.c: Changed the quotation marks to standard
                        (also in string literal).
        * src/dir.c: Changed the quotation marks to standard.
        * src/sdiff.c: Changed the quotation marks to standard.
        * src/util.c: Changed the qutoation marks to standard.

#6.
I then added all the changes of these files by doing 
$ git add .
which then added all the files to git.

I then committed the changes by doing

$ git commit -F ChangeLog
so that when I checked 
$ git log
I could see this as the most recent submission:

commit f25ffcd334ca9498896a12e9006b9eb1086f86d2

        * src/diff.c: Changed the quotation marks to standard
                    (also in string literal).
        ...

#7
By using the following,
$ git format-patch -1 --stdout HEAD > formatted-patch.txt

I made the formatted-patch.txt, which is about 700 lines long of patch.

#8
I sent my partner(Stephanie Lam, UID:204450286, Lab 3) my formatted-patch.txt. 
I scp'd her file onto my linux server and proceeded to check out via git:
$ git checkout v3.0
$ git branch partner

I checked back out into 3.0 and branched into partner.
Then I 
$ git am < formatted-patch.txt
and it patched, saying: 
Applying: 2016-01-29 Stephanie Yintung Lam <classlam@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

Now that the patch is formatted:
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

Afterwards, I tried the following:
$ cat formatted-patch.txt | src/diff . -
src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

This is correct. Instead of `-', we see '-'. Her patch was successful.

#9
Now I checked out the ChangeLog within the directory that was created after the
$ make distdir
$ cd diffutils-3.0.1-4d37b
Inside the changelog, the most recent log was:

    2016-01-29  Stephanie Yintung Lam  <classlam@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu>

#10
I downloaded X-11 from the link from piazza(The application name = XQuartz)
and restarted my computer. I then ssh'd back into rayz@lnxsrv.seas.ucla.edu
and then 
$ cd emacs
and then ran 
$ gitk
And the graphic interface popped up. The rest of #10 is in my
gitk-screenshot.png and gitk-description.txt.
